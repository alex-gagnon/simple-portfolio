    I have been developing automated test suites and software for several years now. I enjoy learning new languages in my personal time, both computer languages and world languages.
    I've practiced martial arts for over 20 years and like to teach a few times a week. More recent hobbies I've picked up are the guitar, painting, and scuba diving!
